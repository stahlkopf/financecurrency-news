# seCrawler(Search Engine Crawler)
A scrapy project can crawl search result of Google/Bing/Baidu

### prerequisite
python 2.7 and scrapy is needed.


## commands

run one command to get 50 pages result from search engine with keyword, the result would be kept in the "urls.txt" under the current directory.


#####Bing
```scrapy crawl keywordSpider -a keyword=Spider-Man -a se=bing -a pages=50```

#####Baidu
```scrapy crawl keywordSpider -a keyword=Spider-Man -a se=baidu -a pages=50```

#####Google
```scrapy crawl keywordSpider -a keyword=Spider-Man -a se=google -a pages=50```



## limitation
The project doesn't provide any workaround to the anti-spider measure like CAPTCHA, IP ban list, etc. 

According to my test, Google set the most higher bar for spider to crawl its search result, mostly it would redirect the spider to CAPTCHA page.
